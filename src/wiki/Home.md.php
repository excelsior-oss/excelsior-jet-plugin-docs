Excelsior JET <?php tool(); ?> Plugin
=====

*Excelsior JET <?php tool(); ?> Plugin* provides <?php tool(); ?> users with an easy way to compile their applications
down to optimized native Windows, OS X, or Linux executables with [Excelsior JET](https://www.excelsiorjet.com).
Such precompiled applications start and often work faster, do not depend on the JRE,
and are as difficult to reverse engineer as if they were written in C++.
